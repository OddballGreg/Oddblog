As a software developer hailing from South Africa's very own Johannesburg, I graduated as of of 120 students in WeThinkCode_'s very first software development student cohort (2016 to 2018).

Their course inspired a love for teaching others and sharing knowledge in me, which I have sought to maintain despite having graduated from WeThinkCode_ and entering the professional Software Development Industry.

This said, I was known for taking odd paths towards problem solving at WeThinkCode_ as result of curiousity (or sheer nihilism), and hope to bring this penchant for oddness to this blog by detailing some of the more fun and interesting aspect of my programmatic whimsy.
