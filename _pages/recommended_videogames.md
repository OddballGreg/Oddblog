All work and no play makes jack a dull boy, and I don't really have a better place to put this, but really felt the pressing need to share my completely undesired opinion about video games I've highly enjoyed and believe you should play. 

While this list is (agonizingly) numbered in order of my enjoyment of the game, it is important for me to stress that I have both played all of these games, and that they all are recommendations regardless of their placement on the list. Whilst there are likely games with more complaints than others towards the bottom, if they've made it to the list, then my experience with them was overall positive and enjoyable despite any such complaints.

So without further ado:
